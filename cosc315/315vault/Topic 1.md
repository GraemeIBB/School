### Concepts

**HAL - Hardware abstraction layer**: hides the low-level specifics of devices, so applications and users don't need to know how each device works internally. Simplifies dev and usage because complex hardware interactions are encapsulated behind uniform interfaces

**Starvation**: a process may never get the resources it needs
**Resource contention**: multiple processes compete for limited resources. Dining philosophers
**Deadlock**: processes wait indefinitely on each other
**Fairness vs. efficiency**: Maximizing throughput
