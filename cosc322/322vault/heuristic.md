heuristic (from the greek εὑρίσκω, *eurisko* meaning "I find" or "I discover") is a technique for problem solving more quickly when classic methoids are too lsow for finding an exact or approx soln. 

This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. AKA a shortcut

A **Heuristic Function**, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that **ranks alternatives** in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. 

The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. Doesnt imply that the found soln is the most optimal, but is still valuable as it produces a solution in a non prohibitive amount of time.

Can be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency

Heuristics underliue the whole field of AI and the computer simulation of thinking, as they may be used in situations where there are no known algorithms.
